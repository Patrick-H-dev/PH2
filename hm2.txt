We all know that words can tear us apart
Especially, when aimed directly at the heart.
We do not acknowledge as we should
That words may also change a life for good.
Usually just beautiful side effects, 
Of time taken to write a little text.
Takes not more than a moment to do,
Never realizing the impact of a word or two.
